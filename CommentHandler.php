/**
 * Instructions:
 *
 * The following is a poorly written comment handler. Your task will be to refactor
 * the code to improve its structure, performance, and security with respect to the
 * below requirements. Make any changes you feel necessary to improve the code or
 * data structure. The code doesn't need to be runnable we just want to see your
 * structure, style and approach.
 *
 * If you are unfamiliar with PHP, it is acceptable to recreate this functionality
 * in the language of your choice. However, PHP is preferred.
 *
 * Comment Handler Requirements
 * - Users can write a comment
 * - Users can write a reply to a comment
 * - Users can reply to a reply (Maximum of 2 levels in nested comments)
 * - Comments (within in the same level) should be ordered by post date
 * - Address any data security vulnerabilities
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * comments_table
 * -id
 * -parent_id (0 - designates top level comment)
 * -name
 * -comment
 * -create_date
 *
 */

/**
 * Improvements
 *
 * Data structure:
 * As we know, each comment should be related to a post. If we want to allow
 * all users able to leave a comment without registration, I suggest changing
 * the data structure to below:
 *
 * comments_table
 * -id
 * -post_id
 * -parent_id
 * -name
 * -email
 * -comment
 * -is_approved
 * -create_date
 *
 * I added three new fields "post_id", "email" and "is_approved". Now we can
 * query our comment based on the post, approval status, or for the specific
 * users.
 *
 * Security:
 * There are some security issues, which I mentioned some of them below:
 *
 * -"Mysql_fetch_assoc" and "mysql_query" are deprecated from PHP 7.0, so we should
 * use "PDO" instated of "mysql" to make connection to database.
 *
 * -The code allows for SQL Injection: The code accepts user input and includes it
 * directly in the SQL statement.This allows an attacker to inject SQL into the query,
 * therefore tricking the application into sending a malformed query to the database.
 * When dealing with SQL queries that contain user input, use prepared statements(we
 * should use PDO)
 *
 * -Input Validation: The code does not validate function and user's inputs.for example
 * in "addComment" we should check "$comment" array to make sure all needed parameters
 * for insert has been passed to function.
 * Also, we need to check the type of variables too.
 *
 * -Error handling:
 * The code does not handle errors, and all errors are displaying to the user. If we are
 * going to use this class in other classes in the project may be, it's better to use a
 * try-catch block to manage errors.
 *
 * -Errors are not logged:
 * If you donâ€™t keep a log of database errors, you miss the opportunity to gather information.
 * This information could help you improve the security of your application.You can log errors
 * to the PHP error log or to another file of your choice.
 *
 * Performance:
 * Some changes help us to improve our performance. I mentioned some of them below:
 *
 * -Add constructor function:
 * In the code, we connect to the database for each function separately. It is better to use a
 * variable which will define in the constructor function to connect to the database. In this way,
 * we can maintain or code easily.
 *
 * -Reusable code:
 * In the "getComments" function, we are using the same code to get comments and replies.
 * I propose to have a method to handle this functionality. It's cleaner and easier to maintain.
 * Also, it reduces complexity from O(n3) to O(n).
